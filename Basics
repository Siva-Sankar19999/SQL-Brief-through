                                           SQL
                                           
1)Creating a table : CREATE TABLE table_name(name   VARCHAR(200) ,age INT ,marks INT);

2)WHERE clause is used to filter the rows which satisfies the condition . and * It applies on main table and study diff between where and Having (those are filters for rows)

3)CRUD OPerations are related to rows in tables
      i)CREATE : INSERT INTO table_name(name,age,marks) VALUES ("Ravi",22,450);
      ii)READ  : SELECT * FROM table_name;
      iii)UPDATE : UPDATE table_name SET name="Ravi Kumar";   -> It applies for all rows in the table. so, for a particular row we have to add WHERE clause to it.
      iv)DELETE  : DELETE FROM table_name; -> It applies for all the rows in the row. So , for a particular row we have to add WHERE clause to it.


4)Pagination concept
   i)Limit & offset 
       Limit specifies how many number of rows we want to take.
       offset specifies from where it starts

5)For values comparison in columns we use =,<,<=, etc for numeric values and for * strings we use like operator

6)wildcard characters -> %,_ 
   i) % specifies zero or any number of characters   eg: name like "shirt%" -> for startswith shirt rest can be anything. 
   ii)_ single character of any type and that must be there

7)ORDER BY colname  for ascending or descending order and it applies finally on the query

8) Alter clause is used to add, delete, or modify columns in an existing table
   i) add column : ALTER TABLE  table_name ADD  column_name datatype; -> [ ALTER TABLE player ADD jersey_num INT;]
   ii)Rename column : ALTER TABLE table_name RENAME COLUMN c1 TO c2; -> [ ALTER TABLE player RENAME COLUMN jersey_num TO jersey_number; ] 
   iii)Drop a column : ALTER TABLE table_name DROP COLUMN column_name; -> [ ALTER TABLE player DROP COLUMN jersey_number; ]
   
9) IN and Between operator
   i) In operator is used as replacement of multiple or conditions (but or condition should be checked on same column value only)
           eg: SELECT * FROM product WHERE brand IN ( "Puma", "Levi's", "Mufti", "Lee", "Denim");
           
   ii) Between operator is used as replacement of multiple and condtions (but and condition should be checked on same column value only)        
           eg: SELECT * FROM product WHERE price BETWEEN 1000 AND 5000;
           
10) Alias name -> as 

11)Aggregation -> Combining multiple values in a column into a single value is called aggregation
    eg: count,sum,min,max,avg etc
  
12) Group By and Having
    i)Group by is used to divide the table into multiple groups (virtually) based on which have the same values for the mentioned attributes [ eg: group by name ]
      and then we can perform aggregation operations on each group 
      
      eg: necessity condition : Query for average marks scored by one student in the class table
                                i) select avg(marks) from class_table where student_name="Ravi";
                              
                                in above condition we want all students avg marks -> then we use group by and perform aggregation
                                
                                ii) select avg(marks) from class_table group by student_name;
                                
                                problem solved by group by :-)
    
    
    ii)Having is used to filter the rows on GROUP BY output
        
        eg: SELECT avg(marks) as avg_marks FROM class_table GROUP BY student_name HAVING avg_marks >50;
