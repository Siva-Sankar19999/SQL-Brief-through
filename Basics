                                           SQL
                                           
Creating a table : CREATE TABLE table_name(name varchar(200),age int,marks int);

WHERE clause is used to filter the rows which satisfies the condition . and *It applies on main table and study diff between where and Having (those are filters)

CRUD OPerations are related to rows in tables
CREATE : INSERT INTO table_name(name,age,marks) VALUES("Ravi",22,450);
READ   : SELECT * FROM table_name;
UPDATE : UPDATE table_name SET name="Ravi Kumar";   ->It applies for all rows in the table. so, for a particular row we have to add WHERE clause to it.
DELETE : DELETE FROM table_name; -> It applies for all the rows in the row. So , for particular row we have to add WHERE clause to it.


Pagination concept
Limit & offset 
Limit specifies how many number of rows we want to take.
offset specifies from where it starts

For values comparison in columns we use =,<,<=, etc for numeric values and for *strings we use like operator

wildcard characters -> %,_ 
   % specifies zero or any number of characters   eg: name like "shirt%" -> for startswith shirt rest can be anything. 
   _ single character of any type and that must be there

ORDER BY colname1,colname2 for ascending or descending order
